# Meme Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Meme Sentiment Analysis project! This repository hosts the code and findings from our exploration into sentiment analysis within the context of memes. We've employed various machine learning and deep learning models to understand and classify the sentiments expressed in meme content.

## Project Highlights

- Diverse dataset for training and testing models
- Implementation and evaluation of eight models, including traditional classifiers and neural network architectures
- In-depth analysis of model performance and insights into challenges faced by different methodologies
- Recommendations for future work and enhancements

## Key Sections

- **Dataset**: Explore the composition and structure of the dataset used for training and testing. See [Dataset](./docs/dataset.md).
  
- **Model Architecture**: Dive into the details of the models employed, their strengths, and limitations. Visit [Model Architecture](./docs/model_architecture.md).

- **Results and Discussions**: Gain insights into model performance variations, challenges faced by neural networks, and recommendations for future work. See [Results and Discussions](./docs/results_and_discussions.md).

- **Conclusion**: A summary of key findings and the significance of tree-based models in achieving higher accuracy.
