## Introduction

In the realm of meme sentiment analysis, this project aims to explore the effectiveness of different machine learning and deep learning models. The repository contains implementations and evaluations of eight models, including traditional classifiers and neural network architectures.

## Dataset

A diverse dataset was used for training and testing the models. The dataset includes meme content with associated sentiment labels. Details about the dataset and its structure can be found in the [Dataset](./docs/dataset.md) documentation.

## Model Architecture

The project utilizes a variety of models, such as Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, CNN, and others. The [Model Architecture](./docs/model_architecture.md) documentation provides insights into the performance of each model and discusses their strengths and limitations.

## Results and Discussions

The [Results and Discussions](./docs/results_and_discussions.md) section highlights the performance variations among the models, challenges faced by neural networks, and the need for contextual adaptation. It also suggests potential areas for future work.

## Conclusion

The [Conclusion](./docs/conclusion.md) summarizes key findings and the significance of tree-based models, particularly Random Forest, KNN, and Extra Tree Classifier, in achieving higher accuracy in sentiment classification within memes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, refer to the [Getting Started](./docs/getting_started.md) guide. It provides information on setting up the environment and running the code.

## Usage

Detailed instructions on using and running the code are available in the [Usage](./docs/usage.md) documentation.
